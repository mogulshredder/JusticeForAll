<h2>Pro Se</h2>

<h4>Basics</h4>
<p>Youâ€™ve chosen to proceed as a Pro Se Litigant. Now pick a
hypothetical, or search for other hypotheticals using different
keywords, so you can learn about possible process methodologies for
your type of case in the Circuit Court of Wyoming.</p>

<p>As you watch a series of videos from the hypothetical you have
chosen, you will have an opportunity to take quizzes so you can earn
tokens that may be used later for a reduction in filing fees or
credits toward legal representation if you choose to hire an
attorney. The videos will be broken up into learning phases relating
to steps in a lawsuit: (a) Filing the lawsuit and serving your
defendant, (b) Serving discovery requests on defendant, (c) Taking
depositions of relevant witnesses, (d) Filing motions as needed for a
non-responsive defendant, preparing exhibits and learning how to get
them admitted in court, and scheduling and attending hearings (e)
Trial preparation; learning how to testify as a Pro Se Litigant, how
to perform direct and cross examinations, how to get exhibits admitted
properly and how to handle voir dire, opening statements and closing
  arguments.</p>
